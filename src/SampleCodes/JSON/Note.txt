Java JSON
Java JSON tutorial shows how to do JSON serialization and deserialization in Java with JSON-Java.
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
It is easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate. It is less verbose and more readable than XML. The official Internet media type for JSON is application/json. The JSON filename extension is .json. JSON is directly consumable by JavaScript.

It parses JSON documents into Java objects and generates new JSON documents from the Java classes.

Java JSONObject
JSONObject is an unordered collection of name/value pairs.
Its external form is a string wrapped in curly braces with colons between the names and values, and commas between the values and names.
The internal form is an object having get and opt methods for accessing the values by name, and put methods for adding or replacing values by name.
JSonObject is transformed into a JSON string with the toString method.
